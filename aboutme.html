			<p>My name is Sergio Elias, I am an alumni student from University of California in Irvine. I obtained my Bachlerâ€™s Degree in Computer Science with an emphasis in Information. I am an Orange County resident and transferred in to UCI in 2015 from Santa Ana College. I'm a very energetic person who's always willing to learn new things. When given the chance to do something, I am determined to commit myself through hard work and work diligently through the end. I'm a person who understands the value of teamwork and communication. I highly value the importance of self-learning and staying competitive by continuously acquiring new skills. I like to listen to other people and understand their values.</p>
