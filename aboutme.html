			<p>My name is Sergio Elias, I am a senior at University of California in Irvine. I will be graduating Spring 2018 with a Bachlerâ€™s Degree in Computer Science, and a minor in Statistics. I am an Orange County resident and transferred in to UCI in 2015 from Santa Ana College. I'm a very energetic person who's always willing to learn new things. When given the chance to do something, I am determined to commit myself through hard work and work diligently through the end. I'm a person who understands the value of teamwork and communication. I am a person that is capable of asking the right questions when needed. I highly value the importance of self-learning and staying competitive by continuously acquiring new skills. I like to listen to other people and understand their values.</p>
