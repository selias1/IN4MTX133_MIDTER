             <section class="education-details"> 
              	<h3><u>User Interviews</u></h3>
	          	<p>User interviews plays very important role when we are in the first stages of software development. it helps the developer to set up goals and objectives that can lead to successful project.Here the user were asked questions about their experience and goals as well as their expectations for any sort of personal  website. </p>
             <br></br>
             <p>If you are interested of viweing the full interview questions and responses.<a href ="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eXB3Ij6xsSRC4hQc2UH8R4iBZ4GQfe-ZLwk38T6hfeM/edit#gid=1719816997">You can Click here to view them</a></p>
	     <h3><u>Competitor Analysis</u></h3>
	          	<p>A competitor analysis is also plays very important role in software development in which researchers analyze the 
                         strengths and weaknesses of different or particular features
                         in similar or different websites. It leads the developer to know and determine which features to implement and focus 
                         on their projects and also which one to ignore when creating their project.For my website, I conducted a competitor 
                         analysis on three different personal portfolio websites which they are students in the same field as me. </p>
             <br></br>

	     <h3><u>Feature Value Matrix</u></h3>
	          	<p> By assigning numerical values to each feature/function and(give a description to their details) .Those values based on user
                         value, business value, and development effort .Feature Value Matrix allows us to organiz the features and from there we can conclude which features meet the objectives of my personal website. </p>

	     <h3><u>Feature Prioritization</u></h3>
	          	<p>The features were prioritized based on the values assigned in the feature value matrix. The features with the same
                         values were places close to each other, but were more specifically prioritized based on findings through the user interviews and
                         competitor analysis. </p>

                <h2>User Test</h2>     
             </header>
             <section class="education-details"> 
              	<h3><u>User Stories</u></h3>
	          	<p> The way I look at user stories is like another important strategy to describe the requirements of my Project.
                          User stories are important because it takes us from the stage of writing about features to the stage where we start to discuss those features. The user tha played important role on my website was "hiring manager". A hiring manager main focus is to learn more about the candidate to see if they have the capabilities to do the work.

             <h3><u>Cognitive Walkthrough</u></h3>
	          	<p>Cognitive walkthroughs one of most important steps to develope a successful project. It allows the developers to actually see how users interact from the first stage until the final satge with their project prototype to final version. This test make the developers become aware of faults that they never considered or imagined.The answers I gather in Cognitive walkthroughs saved me time and efforts to avoid mistakes in futur when I interact with a user. </p>

            <h3><u>User Test</u></h3>
	      <p>For the user test I choose two different types of user tests.The navigation test and the question test.</p>
              <br></br>
              <p>For the navigation test,I asked the users where they suppose to click if they want to send me an email.To send me an email you should navigate to the "Contact me" section of my portfolio. I conducted this test to see if the user will have some easy access if they want to contact me ,and the responses were vary from user who related to computer science field and to thers who just are regular users .

              </p>
             <br></br>
             <p>For the question test, I asked the users about their opinion of my technical skill chart and if they can understand it, the majority agree that they were able to figuer out the meaning of the technial skill chart

                <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>     
             </header>
             <section class="education-details"> 
              	<p>I felt that User tests and Cognitive Walkthroughs were the most useful aspects of User Testing. For Cognitive Walkthroughs I was able to observe users navigate through my web page and see if there were any aspects to my website that they felt was unintuitive. Fortunately, most of my users did not have any issues with the way how my website was designed since they were able to find everything that they wanted to see.</p>

                <br></br>
                <p>User tests were extremely useful because it provided much needed feedback that I needed to cover some aspects to web design that I did not account for. Most people generally found my skills page to be useful and a very effective way to gauge my technical abilities. But, there were few people that felt that it was not too effective. One user mentioned that the way how my webpage was designed did not provide enough information. I had bars that were colored in to show my skill level, but to them, it was just simple bars that were meaningless. Another user mentioned that bars were not an effective means to showcase my skill level because they felt that it was too subjective. Instead, they offered a different solution, and that solution was to provide links to my personal projects and let the user decide the level of skill for themselves.</p>
                <br></br>

                <h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>     
             </header>
             <section class="education-details"> 
              	<p>After much thought and consideration, I decided to leave the design of my technical skills section the way it is. The purpose of that section was to show the user of the website a general idea of how I gauge MYSELF and how confident I feel about my skill level in that particular language. Furthermore, I had an interviewer ask me how I would rate myself and I feel that the current design best answers that question. However, I do plan on changing it up a bit. Rather than showing bars, I think I am going to put a bar split into ten pieces and color individual pieces in to better quantify my skill level.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>I also plan on adding a github icon at the very bottom of my webpage along with my linkedin and facebook icon. This is in response to my lack of showing my personal projects. However, I feel that it is not good enough to just provide links to my github account because it requires the user to manually download and build the project to see it in action. Instead, I plan on bettering my skills as a web developer to showcase my projects by directly linking it to a webpage, which does not require any part in the user and show the fruits of my successes in web development. </p>
