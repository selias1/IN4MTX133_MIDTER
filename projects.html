		<h1><font face = "times" size = "14" color = white>About Me</font></h1>
		<p>My name is Sergio Elias, I am a senior at University of California in Irvine. I will be graduating Spring 2018 with a Bachlerâ€™s Degree in Computer Science, and a minor in Statistics. I am an Orange County resident and transferred in to UCI in 2015 from Santa Ana College. At the age of age of 30 years old, life has giving me a lot of lessons and experiences. However, the value of education is very important because knowledge is passed through generations. University of California in Irvine has prepared me with the best education and for the years to come. My goals after undergrad school is to obtain a field related occupation in Data Analysis / Data Mining for work experience and in the future to proceed with graduate school.</p>
